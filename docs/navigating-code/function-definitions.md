# Navigating to function definitions
`, g g` go to the source code definition of the Clojure function under the cursor.  If the cursor is not on a function name, a prompt displays asking for the function name.

`, g G` to open the definition in another window

`' '` returns to the point in the code you originally jumped from.

> #### Hint::Run the REPL for best results
> `cider-find-var` is used when a REPL is running, otherwise `dumb-jump-go` is called.
>
> `clojure.core` functions are known to CIDER. Custom functions, i.e. `defn` expressions in the project, must first be evaluated in the REPL.
>
> If `, g g` is not working, try evaluate any expression from the project and try `, g g` again.


## Listing functions
`SPC j i` lists matching functions of using the name under the cursor

Functions can come from anything that is on the classpath, including Java sources if they are installed.

> #### Hint::Java classes and methods
> `, g g` also works for Java definitions once the Java sources are added to your project.  See the section on [Java Definitions](java-definitions.md)
