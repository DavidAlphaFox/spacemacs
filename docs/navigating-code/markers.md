# Navigating using markers

Markers are used to create adhoc places to jump to in your buffer.

`m` and a character defines the name of the marker.  For example, `m a` defines a marker called `a`

`'` and a character jumps to that marker, so `' a` jumps to the marker called `a`

`' '` will jump back to the point where the last change was made.

> #### Hint::Only one marker, use the same character
> Marker names are case-specific, so in theory you have have up to 52 markers.
>
> Recommend only using one marker and the same character for the marker each time, as this will ingrain the action.  Using `a` as the marker is quicker as its on the opposite hand to `m` and `'`
