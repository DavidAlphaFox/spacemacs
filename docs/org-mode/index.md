# Org-mode
Org-mode provides a simple way of creating rich documentation and exporting to multiple formats.

Org-mode can also manage tasks (TODO lists), keep your schedule (org-agenda) and even [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) (babel).

## Getting started with org
Open or create a new file with a `.org` filename extension to start org-mode major mode.

For example, if you want to write a guide to your project, you could create an org-mode file called `user-guide.org`.  When you open this file in Spacemacs, org-mode is selected as the major mode for editing.
