# Switch to Spacemacs develop branch
Until the release of Spacemacs 0.300 it is highly recommended to use the Spacemacs `develop` branch. If you have installed the default Spacemacs `master` branch, follow these steps to switch smoothly to Spacemacs `develop` branch.

If you have not customized the `.spacemacs` file then simply delete it and checkout the `develop` branch in `.emacs.d`.  Starting Emacs will create a new .spacemacs file with the latest updates.

```shell
cd ~/.emacs.d
git checkout develop
```

## Updating to develop - keeping .spacemacs changes
If you have changes in the `.spacemacs` file you wish to keep, there are two approaches.  Either update Spacemacs on top of your changes or replace the configuration and use a diff tool to copy your changes back to the `.spacemacs` file.

{% tabs overwrite="Update Existing Configuration", clean="Clean install and diff changes" %}

<!-- Update existing Spacemacs configuration in place -->

{% content "overwrite" %}
Make a backup of your `.spacemacs` file.

Change into the `~/.emacs.d/` directory and change the Git branch to `develop`

```shell
cd ~/.emacs.d/
git checkout develop
```

`SPC f e D` (`spacemacs/ediff-dotfile-and-template`) to compare the develop version of the `.spacemacs.template` with your customized `.spacemacs` configuration.

In the ediff buffer, use `j` and `k` to navigate changes, `b` to copy changes from the `spacemacs.template` to your custom `.spacemacs` configuration.

You should accept all changes unless you know that you should keep a specific change (eg. layers, variable settings).

`q` to quit the ediff session.

`SPC f s` to save the .spacemacs file.

Delete the `~/emacs.d/elpa/` directory, as packages will downloaded under `~/.emacs.d/elpa/develop/<emacs-version>/`.


<!-- Clean Spacemacs install, using ediff to add any changes -->

{% content "clean" %}
Delete the `~/.emacs.d` directory (backup any changes made in `.emacs.d/private` if relevant).

Clone Spacemacs specifying the `develop` branch

```shell
git clone -b develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Move the  `~/.spacemacs` file or rename it, allowing Spacemacs to create an updated configuration from the `develop` branch.


## Start Emacs
Start Emacs.  Select the editing style (vim, emacs) and spacemacs distribution (full, minimal) to use and Spacemacs creates a new `.spacemacs configuration`.

Spacemacs will download the distribution packages and packages for the default set of layers.  This may take a couple of minutes.


## Update the Spacemacs configuration
If you have changes from the original Spacemacs install:

`SPC D f f` to open ediff.  Select the `~/.spacemacs` file first and then your `.spacemacs` backup file.

`j`, `k` navigates (down/up) between each difference in the file.  `b` copies a change from your custom `.spacemacs` file to the `~/.spacemacs` file now used by Spacemacs.

`?` to list the diff commands (when the cursor is in window 3)

`q` to quit the ediff session (when the cursor is in window 3) and `SPC f s` to save any changes made to the `.spacemacs` file.

## Restart Emacs to load all changes
`SPC q r` (`emacs-restart`) to ensure your .spacemacs changes and packages are loaded.  This may take a minute if you added layers to the `.spacemacs` configuration file.

Once Spacemacs restarts you are ready to enjoy Spacemacs `develop`.
