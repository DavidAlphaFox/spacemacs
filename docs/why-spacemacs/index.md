# Why Spacemacs

Spacemacs provides highly productive tooling for any software development, supporting numerous programming languages and tool configuration syntax (Dockerfile, Makefile, Yaml, etc)

Spacemacs takes the raw power of Emacs and adds years of experience from the community.

Spacemacs uses Vim-style modal editing, providing simple use and learn key bindings for common tasks, dramatically enhancing productivity and fun.

Spacemacs is fast to startup and lightweight thanks to its lazy loading of features.  So it only loads in those features you need.
