# Magit Forge - issues, PRs and forking
Magit Forge is used to talk to GitHub, GitLab and similar services, collectively referred to as forges.

Forge can retrieve the list of issues and pull requests from a remote repository. Issues, pull requests and forks can be created on a remote repository.

`@` opens the forge menu from the Magit Status buffer, `, g s`, and therefore requires a local Git repository.
