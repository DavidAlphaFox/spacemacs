# Clojure Repl
The Clojure REPL is a live environment in which your Clojure code runs.  Using a REPL to develop your code gives you instant feedback on its behaviour and supports rapidly evolving design.

Clojure developers can use the REPL to evaluate (run) a whole file of code, or just a single expression.

## Quick start (Vim normal state)
`SPC f f` open a Clojure source code file from a project

`, '` or `, s i` to start a Clojure REPL using [Clojure CLI](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/install/install-clojure.html), Leiningen or Boot.

`, e f` evaluate the current Clojure expression and show the results inline

`, e ;` evaluate the current Clojure expression and show the results as a comment

`SPC p a` toggle between matching source code and unit test buffers

`, e b` evaluate all code from the current buffer within the REPL

`, t a` run all test functions in the REPL using the cider test runner

`, m q r` to restart the REPL (i.e. when adding a library as a dependency to the project)


> #### Hint::Documentation enabled after evaluating a namespace
> `, h h` shows the documentation for a function under the cursor, but only if a namespace has been evaluated first.  This applies to `clojure.core` functions as well as project and library specific functions.
